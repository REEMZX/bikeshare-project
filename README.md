# Bikeshare Analysis

### Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze bike share data for different cities (Chicago, New York City, Washington) and provide various statistics and insights. The user is prompted to input the city, month, and day they wish to analyze. The program then loads the data for the specified city and filters it based on the selected month and day.
The project provides the following functionalities:
Time statistics: Calculates and displays the most frequent times of travel, such as the most common month, day of the week, and start hour.

- Station statistics: Calculates and displays the most popular start and end stations, as well as the most frequent combination of start and end stations for trips.

- Trip duration statistics: Calculates and displays the total and average trip duration.

- User statistics: Provides information about the types of users (e.g., subscribers, customers) and, if available, the gender and birth year distribution of users.

- Displaying raw data: Allows the user to view the raw data in the DataFrame, displaying 5 rows at a time.
After each analysis, the user is asked if they want to view more raw data or restart the program..
